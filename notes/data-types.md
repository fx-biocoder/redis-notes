# Supported data types for Redis' in-memory database:

- Strings (up to 512 MB of string data per key)
- Lists (doubly linked lists with push/pop operations)
- Sets (similar to lists but do not allow repeated values)
- Hashes (key-value pair mappings)
- Sorted sets (sets sorted by specific value)
- Streams (streams of data that can be distributed to different clients)
